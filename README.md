# SecAlignVisualizer
SecAlignVisualizer is a tool for visualizing multiple sequence alignments with secondary structure annotations. It parses PDB files to extract helix and sheet information, maps this information to sequence alignments, and generates an HTML representation with color-coded secondary structures.
